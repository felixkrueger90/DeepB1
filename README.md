# DeepB1

This repository contains Python code for implementing a neural network to estimate complex, channel-wise, relative 2D B1+-maps from a single gradient echo localizer to overcome long subject-specific pTx calibration times as described in [1]. MATLAB algorithms to process the data sets for network traing and subsequent pulse desing are also included. The data sets containing relative B1+ and localizer data of the human body at 7T and the neural network`s weights are available at:https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21268650.v1, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21268659.v1, and https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21269115.v1. The B1+ maps were computed as described in [2].

Usage
--------

Run the script DataProcessing.m: The user can load the exemplary data set GRE_B1R_109.mat. The data set can be processed to be suitable for network training. Save the variables lvLovalizerInput and lvB1POutput to be used for networkt training. The neural network can be implemented and tranined using NetworkTrainingAndDataPrediction.ipynb. The predicted results can be used for phase-only static pTx pulse design using Pulsedesign.m. The complete network training relies on all data available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21268650.v1, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21268659.v1, and https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21269115.v1.

Dependencies
------------
These routines were tested under MATLAB R2020a under Windows, but should also run under older versions.

The data libraries for traning and in vivo application  containing channel-wise B1+ maps and complex localizers, as well as the network`s weights are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21268650.v1, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21268659.v1, and https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21269115.v1.

The optimization of the static ptX pulse relies on code from Sebastian Schmitter. The function catstruct.m can be found under https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7842-catstruct, MATLAB Central File Exchange coded by Jos van der Geest.
